    <p>Hello, My full name is Daniela Aitana Graterol Puente and I am Venezuelan and Chilean I was born here in Canada but all of my family lives in South America. I lived in Chile for five years and came back to Ottawa three years ago. My experience down in Santiago, Chile was unique and I am grateful for the lessons I learned and the privilege of getting in touch with my roots. I got to meet family members for the first time and enjoy waking up to the view of the snowy andes. I value my family more than anything. Without them, I couldn't be where I am today, and for that I will do everything I can in life to make them comfortable and happy. Especially my parents.
    </p>
    <p> My passions in life are the following: Soccer (total of 13-14 years and 8 competitive), Brazilian Jiu jitsu(6 years of bliss and competition, poetry, and painting. I also have a knack for languages and am always eager to cultivate more of them. In regards to >BJJ, I will not talk too much about it because if I am given the space I will bore you to death. All I will say is I am passer in my style of BJJ which means I am the person who attacks from top. As for poetry, I write both in <strong> Spanish </strong>and in <strong> English </strong> .  aren't many things that make incredibly proud of myself however, I am proud of my poetry and art. I am self taught and am born in a family of artists. They give me the kind of support that only an artist can give to another.</p>
    <p>As for the quote that I would like to insert, it is of my own. As previously mentioned, I am a fan of poetry. My quote is the following:<blockquote> "Maybe I don't need flowers".<cite> - Daniela Graterol Puente</cite></blockquote>  There is a need for more context because of the poem, but if you would like to read the rest I would be more than happy to provide it. The poem is called Pansies. When I had finished writing the poem, it gave me a rush of strength, this most likely doesn't make sense but that's okay.</p>
